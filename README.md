# ApiRTC-angular
"ApiRTC-angular" appears to be related to WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) and Angular.
WebRTC is a technology that enables real-time communication directly between web browsers or other applications without requiring any plugins. It allows for audio, video, and data sharing between users over the internet.

Angular, on the other hand, is a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. It provides a structured way to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

"ApiRTC-angular" seems to be a specific integration or library that combines the capabilities of WebRTC with the Angular framework, making it easier for developers to incorporate real-time communication features into their Angular applications.

Please note that developments in the technology world occur rapidly, and new updates or changes might have taken place since my last update. To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking official documentation, forums, or repositories related to "ApiRTC-angular" or WebRTC in combination with Angular.
